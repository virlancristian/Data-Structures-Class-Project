## Data Structure Class Project

This is a project I done during my Data Structures class in university
It consists of a program which creates an elimination bracket for a lanparty tournament using linked lists, queues, stacks and trees

For more information about the project, go to the following link(it's written in Romanian): https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/sda-ab/tema1

The repository also contains a detailed explanation of how the program works(it's in Romanian as requested for the project)
